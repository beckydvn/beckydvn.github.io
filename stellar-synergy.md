# Stellar Synergy
"Stellar Synergy" is a two-player couch co-op platformer game. Players work together to control a single mech. The player must coordinate to defeat enemies and carefully navigate the dangerous terrain. Players also control the mech from their phones by connecting to a local NodeJS site hosting the controls, which sends the input to the game through a Websocket server. This allows for mobile-specific controls such as "aiming" the phone to aim the gun. "Stellar Synergy" was created in a group in a 4th year class. I built the networking functionality for the game which allowed for multiple players and phone connectivity.

The game was the recipient of the Queen's 2024 Creative Computing Showcase: Best Video Game Award, and was later presented at the Toronto CNE (Canadian National Exhibition).

Since the game is multiplayer and requires a server for remote connection, and the team didn't have access to a central server, it is not available to play online. However, the [project GitHub](https://github.com/jayttk02/CISC-496-GDP-2) includes instructions to play the game using your local device as the server, including multiplayer functionality and mobile phone controls!

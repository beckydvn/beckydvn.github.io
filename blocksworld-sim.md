This is a 3D simulation that I created of the well-known "blocksworld" classical planning problem. It allows users to specify a customized initial state and goal and simulates the planning process from beginning to end. The goal of the project was to play around with the practical application of automated planning in a game environment. This project was built using Unity 3D and scripting in C#.

# About Me
Hi there! I'm a first year Computing/AI MSc student. I'm currently researching how epistemic planning can be augmented with BDI (beliefs-desires-intentions) agent architecture to create more human-like agents for narrative generation. Outside of school, I love all things artsy and musical (currently learning to play the alto sax). Thanks for stopping by!

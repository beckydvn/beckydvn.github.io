## Stellar Synergy
The. Since the game is multiplayer and requires a server for remote connection, and the team didn't have access to a central server, it is not available to play online. However, the [project GitHub](https://github.com/jayttk02/CISC-496-GDP-2) includes instructions to play the game using your local device as the server, with multiplayer and mobile phone controls enabled!

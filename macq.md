"MACQ" -- short for model acquisition -- is a library for action model acquisition from state trace data. I was a core developer for this library during my internship with the Mu Lab in summer 2021, and the project/accompanying paper was presented at the KEPS workshop at ICAPS 2022. The library is a helpful framework for automated planning researchers to generate a variety of state traces from PDDL code and/or perform various model acquisition techniques on their data. The model acquisition techniques are reimplementations of foundational papers in the space.
